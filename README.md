The third example will e-mail the address admin@prefetch.net with the domains that
will expire in 60-days or less:

    $ domain-check -a -f domains -q -x 60 -e admin@prefetch.net  


# Limitations

Since each registrar provides expiration data in a unique format (if
they provide it at all), domain-check is currently only able to
processess expiration information for a subset of the available
registrars.

**Please submit a patch / pull request if you want to add support for
your registrar and/or TLD.**
